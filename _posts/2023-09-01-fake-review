It is a program that crawls data in real time on the shopping mall (Coupang) web, determines whether fake reviews are available through a classification model, and makes it easy and fast for users.

Based on the fake review information obtained through the undercover survey, a vast amount of data from fake reviewers was collected and the characteristics of fake reviews were analyzed using data analysis techniques.

Announcing this program, we received the Excellence Award at the 2023 Kyung Hee University Software Festival.

This program was also featured in a paper! It is accepted as an undergraduate thesis track for KCSE 2024. We also had the opportunity to present at the conference.
